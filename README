PROGRAMS:
        newspeak:
                USE:
                        - This program finds looks through a text and prints out all the offensives by the person with newspeak and badspeak.
				- This program uses STDIN to input the text stream to the program: 
					- When executing use ./newspeak (arguments). Then type in words and press CTRL-D to end the text stream
                                	- Or simply use < to add a file's text to the STDIN. ./newspeak (arguments) < file.txt.
						- I've included a couple text files, if you want to try out it working.
				-  (./newspeak):
                                        - Arguments:
                                                - -s: Prints the statistics of the operation.
                                                - -h #: Sets hashtable size  (Default is 10000).
                                                - -f #: Sets bloomfilter size (Default is 2^20)
                COMPILE:
                        - To learn how to compile using Makefile, go to the Makefile section.

        Makefile:
                USE:
                        - You can use this file to compile for both of these programs.
                COMPILE:
                        - This is the way to compile:
                                - To compile sorting:
                                        - make
                CLEAN:
                        - This is the way to clean:
                                - To clean all the executables and .o files from the directory.
                                        - make clean
